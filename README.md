# FindMyDoggo
This is a dog finding website application for the 2019 hack merced event where we use machine learning visual image recognition. A user takes a photo of the dog and compares the photo to several other types of the dog type. This allows us to help people find their dogs!

# How To use
1. go to the following URL:
2. Allow the website to access your location
3. Take a photo of a dog anywhere you go
4. Done!

Now we know that we can compare several dog breeds together which allows us to find dogs that have gone missing.
